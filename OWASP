OWASP is globally known for its contributions to web security. With top-ten, zap, juiceshop, etc. it's become a staple and a great way to get your feet wet in web application 
security. Plus, it's all free! This a very valuable website that I strongly recommend taking a look around, looking at their top 10, zap, and juice shop
specifically! :)
