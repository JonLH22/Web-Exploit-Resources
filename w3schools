https://www.w3schools.com/ 

w3schools is the tutorial/teaching based website of the World wide web consortium. It's not exploitation-based but it does have pages on things such as
SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc. I highly recommend this if you're needing a quick reminder of a certain term related to anything web. From HTML, CSS, Jascript 
to JSON, etc. their explanations are short, and they add practical examples. Additionally, they are clear and concise.
