# Web-Exploit-Resources
This is a collection of resources that are focused on Web Exploitation. 

Hey! Thank you for checking this out. :) I am currently focusing on web exploitation hacking and I thought I would create a repository with the resources I've been told about, discovered, and that help me in my hacking escapades! 

There will be a variety of tools, from browser-based to applications. If you have any suggestions of wanting to add anything please let me know and I would be happy to, or you can add them yourself. 

Eventually, when I get more experienced with hacking I will add additional resources that I've found helpful! Thanks again. :)
